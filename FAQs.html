        <h2 class="faqh2">1. How do I create a task?</h2>
        
        <p class="faqp">To create a task, simply log in to your account and go to your dashboard. Click the "Add Task" button, then enter the task title and any additional details. You can also set a due date, add a priority level, or categorize the task before saving it. </p>

<h2 class="faqh2">2. Can I set a due date for my tasks?</h2>
<p class="faqp">Yes! When you create or edit a task, you can set a due date. This will help you stay on track and receive reminders as the due date approaches.</p>

<h2 class="faqh2">3. How do I mark a task as complete?</h2>
<p class="faqp">Once you’ve completed a task, simply check the box next to the task title on your dashboard or task list. This will mark the task as complete and move it to the "Completed" section. </p>

<h2 class="faqh2">4. Can I edit or delete a task?</h2>
<p class="faqp">Yes! To edit or delete a task, click on the task to open the details. From there, you can edit the task title, description, due date, and more. To delete a task, simply click the "Delete" button. </p>

<h2 class="faqh2">5. How can I organize my tasks?</h2>
<p class="faqp">You can organize your tasks using categories or tags. When creating a task, you can assign it to a specific category like "Work," "Personal," or "Shopping." You can also add custom tags to group tasks by priority or project. </p>

<h2 class="faqh2">6. Can I set reminders for my tasks?</h2>
<p class="faqp">Yes! You can set reminders for your tasks when creating or editing them. You can choose to receive reminders via email or push notifications (depending on your device settings). </p>

<h2 class="faqh2">7. Is there a way to view only my completed tasks?</h2>
<p class="faqp">Yes! You can view all your completed tasks by going to the "Completed" section of your dashboard. Here, you’ll find a list of tasks you’ve marked as completed. You can also restore tasks if needed. </p>

<h2 class="faqh2">8. How do I delete my account?</h2>
<p class="faqp">To delete your account, go to your settings page and scroll down to find the "Delete Account" option. Please note that this action is permanent, and all your tasks and data will be erased. </p>

<h2 class="faqh2">9. Can I use the app without an account?</h2>
<p class="faqp">You can use the basic features of our to-do list app without an account, but we recommend signing up for an account to save your tasks and access them from any device.</p>

<h2 class="faqh2">10. Can I sync my tasks with Google Calendar?</h2>
<p class="faqp">At the moment, our app does not directly integrate with Google Calendar. However, you can manually add tasks and due dates to your calendar, or set reminders to keep track of important deadlines.</p>

<h2 class="faqh2">11. Is my data secure?</h2>
<p class="faqp">Yes! We take data privacy seriously. All information entered into your account is stored securely using encryption, and we do not share your personal information with third parties. You can read more about our privacy practices in our [Privacy Policy]</p>
